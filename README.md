App contains dummy functions as I was more interested about maps and their update. You can add meetings and stuff. Other functions are, as I said, dummy and does nothing.
Regarding maps - I was using Open street maps as they are free and open source.
I did not go with Mapbox as I am not so familiar with their api.
Google - most reliable but if you plan to scale price will go up heavily for their use.
That is why I asked you so many questions....
